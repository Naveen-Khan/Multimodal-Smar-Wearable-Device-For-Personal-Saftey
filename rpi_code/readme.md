#🖥️ RASPBERRY PI – Weapon Detection & Evidence Capture System
**🎯 OVERVIEW**
The Raspberry Pi serves as the primary AI processing unit in the Wearable Security System. It runs real-time weapon detection using YOLOv8, manages camera operations, coordinates with ESP32 via TCP, and handles evidence storage.

**Primary Functions:**
1. Real-time Weapon Detection – Processes video stream using YOLOv8 model
2. Evidence Capture – Saves timestamped images upon detection
3. Emergency Coordination – Communicates with ESP32 via TCP
4. System Monitoring – Manages hardware resources and logging
5. User Interface – Optional GUI/CLI for system control
