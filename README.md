This project is a Multimodal Smart Wearable Device designed to detect emergencies and instantly send SMS alerts along with live GPS location to trusted contacts.
It integrates AI-based weapon detection, multilingual voice command recognition, GPS tracking, GSM alerts, real-time evidence collection, and ESP32–Raspberry Pi communication into one compact wearable system.

The system detects emergencies via three input channels:
1. AI-based Weapon Detection (Gun/Knife using YOLOv8 & YOLO11)  
2. Multilingual Voice Recognition (“Help”, “Bachao”, “Maddad”)  
3. Physical Panic Button Trigger
